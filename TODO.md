1. Test what happens when disk is filled with logs.
2. Add method to delete oldest logs when disk reaches threshold (e.g. 80% full)
3. Add GPS time synchronization method, to sync the system clock based on collector stream periodically.
4. Change from using Global log to module level instances for heirarchy
